## Terminology
**Polynomial degree**: highest sum of exponents in a polynomial

**Polynomial order**: polynomial degree + 1, equal to the number of coefficients in a univariate polynomial

**Separable polynomial**: multivariate polynomial representable as a product of univariate polynomials

**Vector polynomial**: function mapping *R* to *R^n*, where each component is a polynomial (example: gradient of a multivariate polynomial)

**Matrix polynomial**: function mapping *R* to *R^(nxm)*, where each component is a polynomial (example: hessian of a multivariate polynomial)
