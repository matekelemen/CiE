## Terminology

- **basis function**: univariate scalar function with local support in *[-1,1]*

- **basis set**: an appropriate set of basis functions. They must vanish on their support boundary except for 2 (nodal) functions that must have unit value for their corresponding limit (-1 or 1)

- **ansatz function**: separable multivariate scalar function with local support in *[-1,1]^d* (constructed from the product of basis functions)

- **ansatz set**: an appropriate set of ansatz functions. Must be constructed from a *basis set* (either a full tensor product or a truncated set)
